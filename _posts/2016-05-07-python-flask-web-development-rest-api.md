### Description:

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Flask is called a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries, it has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions, but if you don’t master Flask, you will miss the opportunity to work with web and mobile applications.  
**What if you could change that?**  
My complete Flask course will show you the exact techniques and strategies you need to connect web or mobile applications to databases, run Flask applications, develop a Flask application and process data from HTML Forms.  
For less than a movie ticket, you will get over 4 hours of video lectures and the freedom to ask me any questions regarding the course as you go through it.  
**What Is In This Course?**  
**Your ****Flask** **Skills Will Be Much Easier.**  
Except if you’re an expert at Flask, Create Web Applications, do Unit Testing With Flask Testing Postman, Build Your First Restful App, do API Authentication And Logging In, Work with Database & WT Forms and Create a Login Page Using Session, you are going to lose many job/career opportunities or even miss develop a Flask application.  
As what Bram Cohen, an American computer programmer, best known as the author of the peer-to-peer (P2P) BitTorrent protocol, says “My favorite language for maintainability is Python. It has simple, clean syntax, object encapsulation, good library support, and optional named parameters.”
