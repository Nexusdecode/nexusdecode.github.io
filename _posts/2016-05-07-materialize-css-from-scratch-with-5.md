###  DESCRIPTION:

This course is for anyone that knows basic HTML and a little CSS that wants to take their frontend website and UI creation to the next level using the Materialize CSS framework which is based off of Google’s Material Design scheme. You will learn all of the CSS and JavaScript components, animations/transitions and build 5 beautiful and completely responsive, real world themes from absolute scratch.  
**Custom Materialize Sandbox**  

I have created a completely custom HTML learning environment for the first few sections of this course. Each lecture has an html page associated with it and has a start state. As we move along through the lectures, you code along with me learning all that Materialize offers including CSS components, utilities, JS widgets and more.
