Java is a widely used robust technology. According to Estimates , 3 billion devices run java.  
This Java Tutorial course is aimed at complete beginners to the subject. For those who have no programming experience or those who have limited knowledge of Java. This Course get you up and running and will give you the skills you need to master the Java programming language.  

The goal of this course is to provide you with a working knowledge of Java applications. We’ll start with the basics, starting from installing Java on different Operating Systems like Window, Mac and Linux on variety of IDE’s e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ Idea, Netbeans etc. Then we will learn all the basic concepts in Java Programming Like Variables, Data Types and Operators, Control Statements Types, Classes, objects, constructors, initialization blocks, type of variables, methods and Garbage collection, Object Oriented Programming Concepts: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Ploymorphism and Abstraction, Access specifier, String, StringBuilder and Wrapper classes, Exception, Enumeration.  
**JavaFX (GUI) Programming**  

The JavaFX is a new framework intended to support desktop applications and web browsers. It is generally a Java platform for creating rich internet applications that can run on a large variety of devices. Since this is a framework for Java, the code written is not machine dependent. The current release provides support for desktop applications running on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux or any other operating system on which Java can be installed.  
We’ll start with the basics, starting from installing JavaFx on variety of IDE’s e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ Idea, Netbeans etc on different Operating Systems like Window, Mac and Linux. Next, We will learn how to create our first JavaFx project. Then we will Learn How to built-in use different JavaFX UI controls like Label, Button, Radio Button, Toggle Button, Checkbox, Choice Box, Text Field, Password Field, Scroll Bar, Scroll Pane, List View, Table View, Tree View, Tree Table View, Combo Box, Separator, Slider, Progress Bar and Progress Indicator, Hyperlink, Tooltip, HTML Editor, Titled Pane and Accordion, Menu, Color Picker, Date Picker, File Chooser.  
In the later half of the video I will also show , How sqlite database can be used with JavaFx.  
**Maven**

Jenkins is an open source automation server written in Java. Jenkins  detects changes in Subversion/GIT…, performs tasks, repeatedly such as Build, Test, Deploy, Package, Integrate.. Jenkins   is A fork of the original Hudson project an is Under development since 2005.  Jenkins plugins extensibility makes Jenkins to adapt to many systems. Jenkins provides everything for a robust continuous integration system which helps a lot for team that practice Agile  Jenkins continuously providing access to the working copies of software which supports the Agile principle.  
The goal of this course is to provide you with a working knowledge of Jenkins CI (continuous integration) tool. We’ll start with the basics, starting from installing Scala on different Operating Systems like Window, Mac and Linux.  
I believe the best way to learn is to understand how a tool works and what it does for you, look at examples, and then try it yourself. That’s how this course is built, with the goal to help you both learn and understand Jenkins .  
**Java Swing (GUI) Programming**  
Swing is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that can be used to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The swing classes are in the Java package javax.swing .  
Here we divide the swing elements into four categories:  
In the first main category we treat the windows and dialogues . These contain all other elements and provide the basic framework for the graphical user interface.  
In the second category you will get to know the menus . Menus are used for program control. Using menus, you can select any function with further dialogs. In addition to the menus for window and dialog control, there are also the context menus, which also provide different functionalities depending on the user interface.
