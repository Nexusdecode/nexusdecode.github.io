First we start off by learning the basics of Python and installing the required tools to write Python code. In this section we cover almost all the Python concepts in an in depth manner, where I will explain each and every line of code. There are over 50+ lectures covering almost all the Python concepts. This includes all the concepts such as data structures, object oriented programming, functional programming, control flow, etc.  
In the next section we learn the basics of Tkinter which will allow you to build desktop Python applications having an attractive user interface.  
Moving along we now are onto the most interesting part of this course, which is Django. Django is one of the most popular web development framework for Python and is use by many big companies worldwide. In this section we cover Django starting right from basics, to the point that we build a sample mini web app using Django.  
Then we learn about Flask which is also a web development framework. We cover all the basic concepts in Flask as well.  
Finally we learn about web scraping, which is one of the most interesting things we could do in Pyhton. We build a web scraper right from scratch writing the code with line-by-line explanation.
