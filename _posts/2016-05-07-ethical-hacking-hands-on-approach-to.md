### Description

This  course provides learners with a basic level of competency using a  hands-on approach to gaining practical experience as a penetration  tester or an ethical hacker (white, grey or black).  
This course  provides a fundamental look at offensive security concepts and  techniques using a virtual install of Kali Linux and three different  target victims, Windows XP, Server 2008 and Linux (Metesploitable2).  This course provides a 100% hands-on on approach to learning to be an  ethical hacker or a pentester.  
**How is the course structured?**  
The  course uses short video tutorials, hands-on labs, virtualization, and  open source tools for step-by-step learning of ethical hacking  fundamentals; the same tools and open source software are used by  professional penetration testers and ethical hackers.  
This course provides videos, labs, and links for downloading the free and open source software used throughout this course.  
You will able to build a virtual install of Kali Linux and Windows XP for the virtual lab environment. **You should complete the first lab of this course before enrolling.**  Starting with lab 2, we will begin scanning and attacking a Windows XP  victim. If the first lab cannot be completed, there is no need to enroll  in the course since all labs that follow are dependent on the first lab  being completed.  
You will learn how intruders escalate privileges  and what steps can be taken to stop them, the importance of a strong  firewall, the importance of keeping systems and software updated and the  use of complex passwords.  
You will also learn how to launch DDoS Attacks, Buffer Overflows, keylogging, and password hacking.  Completion of the course will help prepare an individual for an entry-level  position as a pen-tester or ethical hacker. On completing this course,  you will receive a course completion.  
If you would like to discuss  ethical hacking, watch someone else talk about technology or write a  paper, there are plenty of other courses to choose from. To successfully  complete this course students must demonstrate the fundamental concepts  of offensive hacking. In other words, learners will learn something by  doing.  
**Course Objectives**  

1.  Demonstrate the use of offensive security tools and techniques.
2.  Proficiency in the use of the CLI (Command Line Interface) of Linux.
