### Description:

\*\*\* This Is The Only LibGDX Course That Teaches How To Make Complete Games From Scratch On Udemy!!! \*\*\*  
The course is completely project based, and we are going to create full featured games from scratch using LibGDX framework.  
We will start with simple things so you will be comfortable if you are using LibGdx for the first time.  
You will also benefit from my super fast response if you have any issue that you are stuck with(I check Udemy forums every day if someone posts a question). Oh and all the students taking the course will also be there to help you!  
All project files will be included and you are free to use them for anything that you like, personal or commercial use!  
Lets take a look at the games that we are going to create inside of this course:  
We are going to start with a simple game that I call Jack The Giant. In this game we are going to help Jack climb down the beanstalk, along the way we can jump on white clouds but we need to avoid dark clouds. Besides of creating our gameplay we are going to create menus, implement background music, and much much more.  
The next game that we are going to create is Flappy Bird, and I know what you are thinking oh not another Flappy Bird clone, but this is not a regular Flappy Bird clone, oh no, I’ve added a lot of features that you can’t find in any other flappy bird clone such as selecting a bird(choose between different flappy birds), and many other features that you will see inside of the course.  
Using what you obtain in this course, you will be equipped with more than enough knowledge in order to continue improving yourself in the field of game development, using LibGDX or any other game engine.
