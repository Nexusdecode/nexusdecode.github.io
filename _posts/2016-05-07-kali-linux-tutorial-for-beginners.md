### Description:

Note: Course updated for Kali 2018.2  
You want to learn hacking with Kali Linux but you do not know where to start? Do you find the command line confusing and intimidating? If yes, this is the perfect course for you. In this Kali Linux tutorial, we start you off with the assumption that you know absolutely nothing about Linux! Starting from scratch you will build up your knowledge on how to use Kali Linux and before you know it you will become fluent with the basic tools and commands not just in Kali, but in most Linux systems.  

The course is divided into three parts.  
**Part 1 – Basics**  

*   Commands to help you navigate any Linux system
*   Add/remove software and update/upgrade your system
*   Archive and compress files and folders
*   Use wildcards to make daily tasks easier

**Part 2 – Administration**  

*   Editing files
*   Configuring and managing services
*   Managing users, groups and permissions
*   Chaining multiple commands for greater effect

**Part 3 – Hacking**  

*   Download a minimal Linux and build it from scratch
*   Hack it with Kali Linux!

**Part 4 – Shells**  

*   Understanding bind shells
*   Understanding reverse shell
*   Understanding web shells

​**Part 5 – Hacking Like The Bad Guys**  

*   Exploiting replicas of real life vulnerabilities
*   Getting access and creating backdoors
*   Stealing credit card information
