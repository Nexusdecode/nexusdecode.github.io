### Description:

This course teaches beginners to industry professionals the fundamental concepts of Distributed Programming in the context of python & Django.  We look at how to build applications that increase throughput and reduce latency.  In this course, we will take a dive intially in the irst part of the course and build a strong foundation of asynchronous parallel tasks using python-celery a distributed task queue framework. We will explore AWS SQS for scaling our parallel tasks on the cloud. These fundamentals will aid you in building scalable Python solutions for virtually any python project. By the end of this course, you will have learnt how to use popular distributed programming frameworks for python and Django. Through concepts learnt, you will discover the world of distributed computing with Python and how easy it is to build distributed components into your python or Django projects.  
**Why take this course?**  

*   As to be python developer or Django web application developer, Its important to learn how to build applications that are able to process long running jobs or tasks in a non blocking way e.g sending mass email, map reduce, running high computational functions. Building a chatting applications.
*   This course builds up your skills in distribute programming giving you the tools you need to scale your applications
*   This course consist of projects you can use to implement in your real world projects with the sole emphasis of allowing your applications to become distributed and have asynchronous components
