###  DESCRIPTION:

\*Important note: if you have any concepts you are unclear about, please do not hesitate to ask me.  I’m flattered that over  3000+ people have signed up.  
However, I’m getting very few questions from students even though I’m happy to take them :-)\*  

In this course you will learn HTML, which is the first language you need to master in order to become a successful web developer.
