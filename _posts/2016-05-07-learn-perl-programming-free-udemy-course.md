### Description:

Perl is a general-purpose programming language originally developed for text manipulation and now used for a wide range of tasks including system administration, web development, network programming, GUI development, and more.Perl is an interpreted language, which means that your code can be run as is, without a compilation stage that creates a non portable executable program.Traditional compilers convert programs into machine language. When you run a Perl program, it’s first compiled into a byte code, which is then converted ( as the program runs) into machine instructions. So it is not quite the same as shells, or Tcl, which are strictly interpreted without an intermediate representation.  
It is also not like most versions of C or C++, which are compiled directly into a machine dependent format. It is somewhere in between, along with _Python _and _awk_ and Emacs .elc files.
