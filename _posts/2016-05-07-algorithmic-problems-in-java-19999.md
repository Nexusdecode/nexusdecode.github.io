### Description:

This course is about the fundamental concepts of algorithmic problems, focusing on backtracking and dynamic programming. As far as I am concerned these techniques are very important nowadays, algorithms can be used (and have several applications) in several fields from software engineering to investment banking or research & development.The first chapter is about backtracking: we will talk about problems such as N-queens problem or hamiltonian cycles, coloring problem and Sudoku problem. In the second chapter we will talk about dynamic programming, theory then the concrete examples one by one: fibonacci sequence problem and knapsack problem.In each section we will talk about the theoretical background for all of these algorithms then we are going to implement these problems together from scratch in Java.  

### Who is the target audience?

*   This course is meant for newbies who are not familiar with algorithmic problems in the main or students looking for some refresher

### Requirements

*   Basic Java
