### Description:

“A picture is worth a thousand words”. It is true that concepts are easily understood when explained with the help of diagrams. In today’s data-driven world, it is very important to make the best use of available data in such a way that useful insights are derived from it. Data visualization is the easiest and fastest way to make it possible. D3.js is a popular JavaScript library for manipulating documents in the context of data data. D3 stands for Data Driven Documents. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS.  
D3 allows you to bind data to a Document Object Model, and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. Elements can be added, removed, or modified according to the contents of the data set. For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers or even use the same data to create a horizontal bar chart using SVG. D3 combines powerful visualization and interaction techniques with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.  
“D3.js in Action: Build 12 D3.js Data Visualization Projects” is a 100% practical hands-on course that teaches you D3.js from scratch using the latest available version V5. All concepts are explained in a very detailed and easily understandable manner. The instructor codes along instead of explaining the concepts with already prepared code samples.
