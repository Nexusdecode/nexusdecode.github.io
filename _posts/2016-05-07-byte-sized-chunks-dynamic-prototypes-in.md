###  DESCRIPTION:

Note: This course is a subset of our much longer course ‘Learn By Example: HTML, CSS and Javascript’ so please don’t sign up for both:-)

Javascript objects, prototypes and JSON – that’s what this course is about.  
This is **not** a course on Javascript frameworks – its about solid, fundamental Javascript. You’ll be surprised by how much more you can get done on your web pages once you learn these technologies the right way.  

**What do we mean by that?**  

*   Relatively few folks formally learn HTML, CSS or Javascript, because its quite easy to get stuff done in these technologies in a “quick-and-dirty way”.

*   That “quick-and-dirty” way of learning and doing leads to problems over time, because Javascript and CSS are actually quite complex, so it is easy to do things the wrong way

*   This course will help, because it is entirely built atop examples. Each is self-contained, has its source code attached, and gets across a simple, specific use-case. Each example is simple, but not simplistic.

**What’s Included:**  

*   **Prototypes** are Javascript’s way of doing inheritance, and its very different from the C++/Java way of doing it.

*   **JSON** is not conceptually difficult to use, but it is incredibly important, and you should understand why – because its the glue between backends written in Java or other traditional languages, and front-ends written in Javascript

*   **The Document-Object-Model** is what ties Javascript back to HTML and CSS. Together with JSON, the DOM ties it all together from server to skin.

### Who is the target audience?

*   Nope! Please don’t enroll for this class if you have already enrolled for our 13-hour course ‘Foundations of HTML, CSS and Javascript’ course
*   Yep! Folks who are seeking to learn Javascript the right way – including folks who may done some Javascript programming, but are not quite confident using advanced features such as dynamic prototyping
*   Nope! This class is not right for you if you are looking to learn Javascript frameworks such as JQuery, Angular or Node.js

### Requirements

*   Any modern browser and a simple text editor are all that will be needed for the code examples
*   Some prior programming experience will definitely help!
