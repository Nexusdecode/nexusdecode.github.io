### DESCRIPTION:

Parsing JSON is an integral part of most of iOS applications. The new version of Swift introduced classes and APIs that make JSON parsing easy to handle. This course is all about JSON encoding and decoding using Swift language. You will encounter many different JSON responses and learn how to decode those responses to your models. This course is packed with real world examples and can help you gain a better understanding of consuming JSON APIs for your iOS applications.
