### Description:

Chart JS the missing manual!  
Course is made in the version Chart JS 2.7.2

Why Should you take this course?  

Let me explain my personal story. When I started to learn Chart JS it was a real challenge. Creating charts was already hard, however understanding the documentation was the biggest structure. I could not belief how complicated the documentation was. I felt it was written by expert developers that assume you knew how to already code in Chart JS. Just look at the documentation and a lot is missing out.  
I remembered when I finally was able to get a chart on the page. I felt like I won the jackpot. Finally it worked but I quickly realize that what I really wanted was create charts that are directly connected with my database. And nothing about that single topic is found anywhere.  
Because of this struggle I decided to create this wonderfully detailed course. This is what I coined as the Chart JS missing manual. Why? Because it covers so much in detail en topics not being shown in Chart JS documentation. This course is what I would say the course I wished I had before starting out. It would save a lot of time and could get me up to speed fast.
